# SLTrib+

## Overview
*An extension to update and beautify the reading experience of SLTrib.com - a fine news organization*

### State of the project
On 8/02/17, sltrib.com rolled out their new design, which addresses most of the visual and functional issues this extension was trying to bridge. As an avid reader, I'll continue to make note of UX/UI quirks that irritate me and think of ways to make this a useful plugin again, but as for the foreseeable future, this plugin is deprecated. 

This is a chrome extension that cleans up the design of the Salt Lake Tribune website. It also opens links by default in single page mode. Other fixes are coming. 

## Installation
npm install
gulp watch

#### Chrome:
1. Run gulp build-chrome
2. Navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) or via hamburger menu -> Tools -> Extensions.
3. Enable Developer mode by ticking the checkbox in the upper-right corner.
4. Click on the "Load unpacked extension..." button.
5. Select the "chrome" directory from your ./build.

### TODO
* Port to Firefox
* Enhance Photo Galleries on home page
